// represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal 
// text, independent of its styled presentation.

// small {}


// The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content,

// baseline of its content. In HTML5, this element represents a span of text 
// with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, 
// such as labeling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese 
// proper name mark), or labeling the text as being misspelled.

// u {}
